# Discovering Computer Science - Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from **"Discovering Computer Science: Interdisciplinary Problems, Principles, and Python Programming"** by Jessen Havill, as I learn computer science basics with Python 3.13.

## About the Book

"Discovering Computer Science: Interdisciplinary Problems, Principles, and Python Programming" is a problem-oriented introduction to computational problem solving and programming in Python, appropriate for a first course for computer science majors, a more targeted disciplinary computing course or, at a slower pace, any introductory computer science course for a general audience.

Realizing that an organization around language features only resonates with a narrow audience, this textbook instead connects programming to students' prior interests using a range of authentic problems from the natural and social sciences and the digital humanities. The presentation begins with an introduction to the problem-solving process, contextualizing programming as an essential component. Then, as the book progresses, each chapter guides students through solutions to increasingly complex problems, using a spiral approach to introduce Python language features.

The text also places programming in the context of fundamental computer science principles, such as abstraction, efficiency, testing, and algorithmic techniques, offering glimpses of topics that are traditionally put off until later courses.

## Key Features

- **30 well-developed independent projects** that encourage students to explore questions across disciplinary boundaries
- **Over 750 homework exercises** 
- **300 integrated reflection questions** that engage students in problem solving and active reading

## Companion Website

The accompanying website — https://www.discoveringcs.net — includes more advanced content, solutions to selected exercises, sample code and data files, and pointers for further exploration.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by chapters, with each chapter directory (`ch02/`, `ch03/`, etc.) containing:
- Exercise solutions
- Project implementations
- Supporting data files
- Reference materials

## Development Environment

- **Python Version**: 3.13
- **Purpose**: Learning computer science fundamentals and solving textbook problems
- **Focus**: Computational problem solving across disciplinary boundaries

## Progress

Working through the chapters systematically, implementing solutions to exercises and projects while building a strong foundation in computer science principles and Python programming.
